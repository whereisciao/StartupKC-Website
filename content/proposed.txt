  <h2>Why a Newsletter?</h2>
  <p>Well, we really want to create a way for people in our local community to keep in touch without having to work so hard.  From Olathe to Liberty, there are small groups of people that have established strong groups, but unless you happen to know someone, it is difficult to get connected with those groups.  If we want to grow and improve our startup community in KC, we need to make it easier for people thinking about starting here to find us.  Nobody should have to wonder whether or not your group exists.</p>
  <p>If you have been working on a startup around here for a while, then you probably know that there are several programs and organizations geared towards helping established businesses, but they usually have expensive membership fees.  The first time entrepreneur living on ramen doesn’t get as much help and we can make it easier for them by giving them easier access to information.</p>

  <h2>What's the Plan?</h2>
  <p>While we are going to spend a good bit of our time talking about software and web startups, we will consider resources and information that helps people build any scale business.  We are going to highlight local businesses, founders, and other members of the startup ecosystem.  We will discuss pertinent business topics and regional events.</p>
  <p>Our major goal here is to increase the number and strength of links in our community so that we can all have important conversations more easily.  The KC metro is pretty spread out, so we don’t have a central hangout spot for the community.  In order for us to get the benefits of seeing and talking with one another, we need to be a little more organized than other places.</p>
